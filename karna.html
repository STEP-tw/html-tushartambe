      Karna is a main character of historic novel Mrutunjay by Shivaji Sawant which based on Mahabharat. He is the son
      of Surya and princess Kunti. Karna was the
      greatest warrior of his generation, who conquered entire ancient India single-handedly. He
      was extremely principled and stood by them even in the face of death. He was also known as "Danveer". Indra, the
      king of Gods, comes to his door asking for his Kavach-Kundal. Kavach is an unpenetrable
      shield that is attached to his skin. Kundal are radiating earlobes which he gets at the time of his birth from
      his father Sun God. Karna rips his Kavach from his body and chops off his Kundal within a split second. In the
      final war of Mahabharata Karna gets killed by Arjun.
